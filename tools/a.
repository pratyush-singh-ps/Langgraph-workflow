The error message you're encountering indicates that certain modules are expected to be part of the project but cannot be found, leading to a `CCP_PARSING_ERROR`. The two missing modules are `new_level_entities_without_budget` and `monitoring_alert_actions_python`.

To address this issue, you should verify the existence and registration of these modules in your project. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Verify Module Registration:**
   Ensure that the missing modules are properly registered in your project's configuration. They need to be defined and included in the module maps or lists that are being processed during the linking phase.

2. **Check for Module Definition:**
   Look through your codebase and configuration files to ensure that there are definitions for `new_level_entities_without_budget` and `monitoring_alert_actions_python`. These definitions should provide details such as module type, entry points, S3 URLs (if applicable), and other relevant configurations.

3. **Environment and Configurations:**
   Verify that the modules are correctly configured in your environment, including any dependency or configuration files. This includes checking paths, names, and versions if your modules are external artifacts like Python wheels or JAR files.

4. **Code Review for Reference:**
   Searching through your codebase, particularly in areas concerning project linking and execution (such as `linkCcpRequest`, project service implementations, etc.), can help identify where these modules are referenced, and ensure they're being correctly initialized and included. Look for configurations like these in `ProjectServiceImpl` or any relevant entity initialization sections.

5. **Example Code Snippet Suggestion:**
   If modules are being created similarly to the following (derived from your provided code snippets):

   ```java
   CCPGraphEntity newModule = new CCPGraphEntity();
   newModule.setName(\"new_level_entities_without_budget\");
   newModule.setModuleType(ModuleType.YOUR_MODULE_TYPE_HERE); // ensure the correct module type
   newModule.setS3Url(\"s3://your-bucket/your-module.whl\"); // example URL; ensure correct URL and availability
   ```

   Ensure that the modules are correctly initialized and added to your project structure in a similar manner as other existing modules.

6. **Check Parsing and Validation Logs:**
   Ensure that your parsing and validation services are correctly processing these modules. There might be logs or messages that further detail why the modules are not found, which can be traced in the `parsingAndValidationService` behavior.

7. **S3 or Repository Checks:**
   If these modules are hosted on S3 or another repository, double-check their availability and permissions.

If the problem persists after these checks, you may want to engage with the wider development team or seek support with your specific project setup, providing details of exactly where these errors occur in your code's execution flow."
